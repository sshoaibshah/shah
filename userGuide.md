## Using Your Website

Your portfolio website is designed to showcase your professional work and make it easy for potential clients to connect with you. The homepage presents your name and tagline prominently, followed by four statistics cards that highlight your key achievements. Visitors can click "Get In Touch" to send you an email or "View Portfolio" to jump directly to your project showcase.

The portfolio section displays six project cards organized by category. Each card shows the project type, company name, title, and description. Projects with live links include a "View Project" button that opens in a new tab. The about section tells your professional story and highlights your work at Auxcube and Riffonix Solutions, as well as your Riffat Foundation initiative.

At the bottom, the contact section features a "Start a Project" button that opens an email to you, along with social media icons linking to your LinkedIn, GitHub, and YouTube profiles. The navigation menu at the top allows visitors to quickly jump to "Portfolio", "About", or "Contact" sections with smooth scrolling.
